                                (Please read the Note below)

Note:
 - This plugin is incompatible with omnicppcomplete due to the
 unconditionnaly set mapping done by omnicppcomplete. So don't forget to
 suppress it before using this plugin.

 - Don't set g:clang_complete_copen to 1 unless you know what you are
 doing. Read carefully the comment at the end of s:ClangQuickFix if you
 want to enable it

 - You're free to use it, to distribute it, but please, don't modify it
 privately, others can be interested by your work. If you have a patch
 or a bug or a feature request, mail me.

Known Issues:
 - If clang is not able to compile your file, it cannot complete
 anything. Since clang is not supporting every C++0x features, this is
 normal if it can do any completion on C++0x file.
